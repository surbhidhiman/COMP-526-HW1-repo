# COMP-526-HW1-repo
This repo contains an example of creating a repository and an interesting README file for SDSU's COMP 526 course.

## This is some large subtitle text 
### This is some smaller headings text 

**This is some cool bold script** \
*This is some fun italic script* \
***This is some super important script*** 


### Some Interesting Things: 
In initializing the repository, I selected the option to add an automatic .gitignore file, and I chose the option for Python script building since that is what I am most familiar with, though much of what is included in the .gitignore file may not be applicable in this repo. 

### Mathematical Notation 
This is an example of using Latex to include mathematical notation in a md file: 
$$\ \vec{V} \ = V^{\lambda} e_{\lambda}$$ 

### Code Sample 
`print('Hello World!)`

### Some Cute Quotes from *Calvin and Hobbes* by Bill Watterson 
> “Know what’s weird? Day to day nothing seems to change, but pretty soon everything is different.”, \
> “A day can really slip by when you’re deliberately avoiding what you’re supposed to do.”, \
> “There’s never enough time to do all the nothing you want.”
